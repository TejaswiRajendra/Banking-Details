1. Repository Name
Purpose: The repository name uniquely identifies your project. You can rename the repository here.
How to Use:
Enter a new name in the text box to rename your repository.
Example: Rename the repository from Banking-Details to Banking-App. This might be needed if the project's scope changes or if you need a more descriptive name.
2. Template Repository
Purpose: Enable this option to make the repository a template that others can use to generate new repositories with the same structure and files.
How to Use:
Check the box to make the repository a template.
Example: If Banking-Details is a boilerplate for banking projects, you can enable this option so that others can reuse its structure and contents.
3. Require Contributors to Sign Off on Web-Based Commits
Purpose: Enforces signing off on commits through GitHub’s web interface. This ensures compliance with repository terms, like the Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO).
How to Use:
Check the box to require sign-off.
Example: For an open-source repository where legal attribution is critical, enable this to enforce accountability for contributors.
4. Default Branch
Purpose: Defines the main branch against which pull requests and commits are made.
How to Use:
Change the branch name by editing the text or selecting a different branch.
Example: Use main as the default branch. However, if you prefer develop as the primary branch during development, set it here.
5. Social Preview
Purpose: Set an image to display when the repository is shared on social media.
How to Use:
Upload an image with a resolution of at least 640x320 pixels.
Example: Add a logo.png or preview.png file to visually represent the project, making it more appealing when shared.
Other Options in the Left Sidebar
a. Collaborators
Purpose: Add collaborators to grant them access to the repository.
How to Use:
Invite team members via their GitHub usernames or email addresses.
Example: Add JohnDoe as a collaborator to help maintain the Banking-Details repository.
b. Moderation Options
Purpose: Set rules for comments and contributions to maintain a healthy community environment.
Example: Ban certain phrases in comments to prevent spamming.
c. Branches
Purpose: Manage branch-specific rules, like protection rules.
Example: Set a rule to prevent direct commits to the main branch to enforce pull requests.
d. Tags
Purpose: Create and manage repository tags for versioning.
Example: Add a tag v1.0 to mark the first release of the project.
e. Actions
Purpose: Automate workflows, like CI/CD pipelines.
Example: Use a GitHub Actions YAML file to deploy the Banking-Details application automatically.
f. Webhooks
Purpose: Trigger external services upon repository events like commits or pull requests.
Example: Notify a Slack channel every time a new issue is created.
g. Environments
Purpose: Configure deployment environments like staging or production.
Example: Deploy the application to a staging environment for testing.
h. Security Options (Code Security, Deploy Keys, Secrets and Variables)
Purpose: Enhance repository security by managing access keys and sensitive data.
Example: Store API keys or environment variables securely under Secrets.

Create Repository:
Name: Banking-App
Template: Enable if it’s a boilerplate.
Set Branch Rules:
Make main the default branch and protect it.
Add Collaborators:
Add team members to collaborate.
Add Secrets:
Store sensitive keys like DB_PASSWORD.
Social Preview:
Add a banner image for better visibility.
Automation:
Use GitHub Actions to deploy code automatically after merging a pull request.
This step-by-step configuration ensures a secure, organized, and collaborative environment for your project.
